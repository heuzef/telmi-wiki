### File: /nodes.json

JSON file containing all the nodes that define the behavior of the game.

The game starts with 'startAction'. Then, an action leads to one or more scenes.  
If multiple scenes are in the action and the currently playing scene does not have `control.autoplay` set to true, the user can switch between scenes in the current action.  
If `control.autoplay` of the current scene is true, the left/right buttons are disabled, and the next action will be triggered at the end of the current audio playback or when pressing the A, B, X, or Y buttons according to the values of `control.home` and `control.ok`.

```json

  "startAction": { // Contains the first action executed when the game starts
    "action": "a0", // Text, action key

## How to make an interactive story

### General Principle

A Telmi interactive story is composed of **repeating narrative phases**.  
Each phase follows a fixed structure:

1. A **main narrative scene** (the phase introduction)
2. Several **choice scenes** (2 to 5 options)
3. Several **consequence scenes** (depending on the chosen option)

This pattern repeats until the end of the story.

### Scene Types

#### Main Narrative Scene

- **Content:** Around 500–800 words  
- **Purpose:** Introduces the story context or the new phase  
- **Control properties:**
  ```json
  "control": {
    "ok": true,
    "home": true,
    "autoplay": true
  }
  ```
- **`ok` action:** Leads to an action containing 2–5 choice scenes

#### Choice Scenes

- **Content:** A very short question, e.g., “Look under the bed?”  
- **Count:** Between 2 and 5 per phase  
- **Control properties:**
  ```json
  "control": {
    "ok": true,
    "home": true,
    "autoplay": false
  }
  ```
- **`ok` action:** Leads to one or more consequence scenes

#### Consequence Scenes

- **Content:** Around 300–500 words  
- **Purpose:** Explains the results of the player’s previous choice  
- **Selection:** Only one consequence scene is played, based on inventory conditions  
- **Control properties:**
  ```json
  "control": {
    "ok": true,
    "home": true,
    "autoplay": true
  }
  ```
- **Effects:** May update the player’s inventory (`items`)  
- **`ok` action:** Leads to the next **main narrative scene**

### Inventory

- The inventory is optional.  
- It can be used to:
  - Determine which consequence scene is played (via conditions)  
  - Update the player's state after certain scenes  
- If no inventory is needed, the `inventory` property must be omitted.

### Base Structure (`nodes.json`)

#### Empty template:
```json
{
  "startAction": {
    "action": "a0",
    "index": 0
  },
  "inventory": [],
  "stages": {
    "s0": {
      "image": null,
      "audio": null,
      "ok": null,
      "home": {
        "action": "backAction",
        "index": 0
      },
      "control": {
        "ok": true,
        "home": true,
        "autoplay": true
      }
    },
    "backStage": {
      "image": null,
      "audio": null,
      "ok": {
        "action": "backChildAction",
        "index": 0
      },
      "home": {
        "action": "backAction",
        "index": 0
      },
      "control": {
        "ok": true,
        "home": false,
        "autoplay": true
      }
    }
  },
  "actions": {
    "a0": [{"stage": "s0"}],
    "backAction": [{"stage": "backStage"}],
    "backChildAction": []
  }
}
```

### Universal Rules

#### `home` property must have `backAction` action

Every scene in the story must include the following property:

```json
"home": {"action": "backAction", "index": 0}
```

This ensures that the player always experiences the same behavior when pressing the back button (X or Y).

#### All `ok` properties must have a unique action

In every scene of the story, the `ok` property must always point to a different action.

Example:

```json
{
  ...
  "stages": {
    ...
    "s21": {
      ...
      "ok": {
        "action": "a21",
        "index": 0
      },
      ...
    },
    "s22": {
      ...
      "ok": {
        "action": "a22",
        "index": 0
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  "actions": {
    ...
    "a21": [{"stage": "s3"}],
    "a22": [{"stage": "s3"}],
    ...
  }
}
```

In this case, even though `a21` and `a22` have identical behavior, they are duplicated so that scenes `s21` and `s22` each have their own unique action.
